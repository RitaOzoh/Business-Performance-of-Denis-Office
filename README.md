Denis Office Supplies Data Analysis

Welcome to the Denis Office Supplies Data Analysis project! In this project, I, as a data analyst, have been employed by Denis to help him gain valuable insights into the performance of his office supplies business over time. To achieve this, Denis has provided a dataset in an SQL file, which I will use for analysis.

Dataset Setup:

1. Download the dataset by clicking on the provided link.

2. Extract the zipped file and obtain the dataset.

3. In PgAdmin, create a new database named "Denis_DB."

4. Import the downloaded dataset into the "Denis_DB" database.

5. Data Analysis Tasks:

Extract relevant information from "Denis_DB" to provide valuable insights into the business performance.

Perform queries to answer the following questions:

-Show all details about properties, orders, and products.

-Select the city and state columns from the "propertyinfo" table.

-Find the dates orders were made and the quantity of orders made.

-Find unique dates when orders were made.

-Discover the different product categories available in Denis' store.

-Retrieve the data from the "order" table and sort it in ascending order of quantity.

-Display all products and their details, sorted in descending order of price.

-Find the five most expensive products.

Extract information related to specific products and orders:

-Identify the name and category of the product with the ID 94.

-List the name and category of products with prices above $200.

-Find the name of products with prices between $50 and $200.

-Retrieve the product IDs of products sold between 07-01-2015 and 10-01-2015.

-Calculate the total worth of all products if there were just 2 of each in the store.
